Factor analysis using the American Trends Panel Wave 99 dataset from Pew Research Center

Welcome to this project, where I will delve into factor analysis using the [American Trends Panel Wave 99 dataset from Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/dataset/american-trends-panel-wave-99/).

In today's data-driven world, the ability to extract meaningful insights from large volumes of information is an essential skill. This project is designed to demonstrate my proficiency in factor analysis, a statistical technique widely used in psychology, social sciences, and in the market research world, where the goal is to identify underlying relationships between measured variables.

The objective of this project is to extract meaningful factors from the [American Trends Panel Wave 99 Pew Research dataset](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/dataset/american-trends-panel-wave-99/) using factor analysis. This dataset, with its breadth of variables, provides a nice playground for factor analysis, which will help us uncover any latent variables influencing the responses.

Throughout this analysis, I've employed Python along with several of its libraries, including: 

  pandas for data manipulation 
  matplotlib and 
  seaborn for data visualization 
  factor_analyzer for the factor analysis, and 
  pingouin for calculating Cronbach's alpha.

I invite you to explore this project further. Here, you'll find detailed steps of the entire data analysis process - from data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, making necessary assumptions for Factor Analysis, conducting factor analysis, to the interpretation of the results. I've taken care to describe each step in markdown, helping to provide a clear understanding of my thought process and the techniques used.

Whether you are a fellow data enthusiast looking to exchange ideas, a recruiter evaluating my abilities, or someone with a general interest in data analysis, I hope you find this project insightful and engaging. Your comments, suggestions, and queries are most welcome. Please feel free to [reach out](mailto:lbatleah@gmail.com). Let's dive in!
